Description: This library is able to create densities, probabilities, random numbers, quantiles, and 
    maximum likelihood estimation for several distributions, mainly the symmetric and asymmetric power 
    exponential (AEP), a.k.a. the Subbottin family of distributions, also known as the generalized error distribution.
    Estimation is made using the design of Bottazzi (2004) <https://ideas.repec.org/p/ssa/lemwps/2004-14.html>, where 
    the likelihood is maximized by several optimization procedures using the GNU Scientific Library, translated to C++ 
    code, which makes it both fast and accurate. The package also provides functions for the gamma, Laplace, and Asymmetric
    Laplace distributions.
